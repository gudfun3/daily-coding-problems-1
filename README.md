# Daily Coding Problems (Java Solutions)

I use the following terms to analyze each algorithm:

* **Time complexity**: Amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.
* **Space complexity**: Extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm (sometimes also referred to auxiliary space).

- **Day 1**:
  - **Given**: List of numbers and a number k
  - **Problem**: Check whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
- **Day 2**: 
  - **Given**: Array of integers
  - **Problem**: Build a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the given array except the one at i.
- **Day 3**: 
  - **Given**: Root to a binary tree
  - **Problem**: Implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree.
