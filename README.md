# Daily Coding Problems (Java Solutions)

I use the following terms to analyze each algorithm:

* **Time complexity**: Amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.
* **Space complexity**: Extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm (sometimes also referred to auxiliary space).

| Day | Domain | Given | Problem |
|-----|--------|-------|---------|
| 1   | Lists | List of numbers and a number k | Check whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. |
| 2   | Arrays | Array of numbers | Build a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the given array except the one at i. |
| 3   | Trees | Root to a binary tree | Implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree. |
| 4   | Arrays | Array of numbers | Find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array in linear time and constant space. The array can contain duplicates or negative numbers. |
